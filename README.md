# Metro Fault Diagnosis
This repository contains code and data used for constructing 
the framework for the metro fault diagnosis model.

## Project Structure


## Datasets

Multiple datasets are used in this project.
However, after testing, some of them 
were not found to be useful for the fault diagnosis model.

Datasets used for Supervised learning models:
- [High-Speed Train Bogie Vibration & Fault Diagnosis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/high-speed-train-bogie-vibration-and-fault-diagnosis)
- [Metro Dataset](https://github.com/EnfangCui/MetroDataset.git)
- [CWRU-1](https://github.com/XiongMeijing/CWRU-1.git)
